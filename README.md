My 56th assignment! In this I updated a chat room application from the course exercises to include some additional functionality.  

I extended the chat room to include message stats, which utilize Chart.js to show messaging traffic over time. I also spruced up some of the visuals on the log in screen and when displaying messages.

I updated the flask websocket server to periodically emit random messages to simulate a busy chat room, so if you use that it will have a more dramatic effect. It can be found here: https://github.com/windikite/PythonRandomChatter
